Come on baby
Let's do the revolution
Six for the record
And seven for the t-shirt
A picture of the band and a ticket for the promised land

Watching all the bouncers
Systematically beating up the dancers
To the rhythm of a pocket of change
Here's the group with all the answers
Vote for the party and keep your mouth shut!

Same chains of command
All the power taken out of our hands
Politics pays the piper in this company land

Come on baby
Let's do the revolution
They say we'll all be equal
When they take control
Vote for the party and wallow in our rock and roll

"Roadie! my guitar!"
