What do you see when you look in the mirror
Two black eyes and a cut up tongue
That's how I feel whenever I'm not near ya
Shaky knees can't hold me up
That's how I feel whenever I'm not near ya

Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
What's a party when the drugs are over
I'm scared to lose you like I lost my mind
That's how I feel whenever I'm not near ya
It's all buzzing like your hand in mine
That's how I feel whenever I'm not near ya

Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun

I've gotta say something, gotta say something
It doesn't matter what you say
All I can do is try my best
Try to talk to you and make some sense

Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun

Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
Come on come on baby, let's have some fun
